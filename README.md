# Timed (power) menu for Rofi

This is a simple (power) menu for Rofi. By default, it has the poweroff and reboot commands on it, but you can add whatever commands you want.

The point of the script is to provide an easily configurable power menu with a cooldown where the numbers will be shown through Rofi as the countdown moves down.

# How to install: 

Just clone the repo and place the script in your PATH (e.g. /usr/bin) or (preferably) add the directory of the script to your PATH variable. If it returns that some command isn't available, install it. Particularly, make sure that you have killall form the psmisc package installed.
